## Homework assignment #4 - Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Task

We were tasked to to create a quiz where correct and incorrect answers would buy or take away time from the quiz. The final time would be your score based on how much time you had left.

The main object to this assignment is to have us create javascripts that would: 

* Make questions and answer arrays
* Generate for each loops.
* Use local storage to store past scores.
* a timer function that will be used for highscore.
